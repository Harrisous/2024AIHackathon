30 second capture time.

Raspberry pi attached to a camera.

The camera feeds video to the server after <capture time>.

We build a web application, that stores the latest <capture time> video. 

First use case : What is the name of the person I just had a conversation with?

For the demo, me and Michael will have a very close up conversation, since the microphone is okay.

The 30 second video gets pushed to a server. The server has a web application running, which interacts with the Gemini API.
